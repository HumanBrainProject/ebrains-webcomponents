# EBRAINS Webcomponents

[Demo](https://humanbrainproject.github.io/ebrains-webcomponents/index.html)

Set of WebComponents for EBRAINS services. WebComponents are namespaced under `ebrains-*`

## Prettier

Code formatting is done using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). If you wish to contribute, please install and use the Prettier extension for your editor/IDE.

## Why IIFE?

We make use of [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) in our WebComponent defintions to avoid polluting the global scope.

## Existing Components

- [ebrains-yt-video/](ebrains-yt-video) Youtube video privacy warning overlay
